HOUSEKEEPING (do first):
- when updating the new file for new bills, first take the old file and turn into maybe just a single string and regex search for the new name to be added. maybe even learn some fast string search algorithm (two pointers??) for practice
############################
	example:
	let text = readInData(cspan.json)

	let addNew = []

	if(!text.contains(newName)){
		addNew.push(newName);
	} else{
		console.log(newName + " was here before");
	}

	writeData(addNew + text);

- make a bottombar and homenav for each of the pages, stop linking back to billpage         *whats wrong with you*






IDEAS:
pieces to add: add interviews from somewhere idk, add house resolutions those are big important, *maybe add a pdf viewer in your thing but thats a bit much since you might need to download all the pdfs*, add latest supreme court and like investigations or something from somewhere, add top bills of the week (most viewed)

sort options: latest action date, introduction date, most viewed????? (find a way to do this)

filter options: filter for senator or representative, filter by house or senate, filter for cspan videos??????????, filter for interviews and shit maybe, filter for lots

theres a problem where if you go into mobile view on inspect element the cspan video doesnt show up, try to see whats wrong there

tie bills to sponsors on their pages, also have summaries for them or something
